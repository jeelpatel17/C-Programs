/ *** Modules in C++ *** /
Like the modules in JS, we have modules in C++ which have the extension of .h and which can be included as other headers
i.e.
    #include "printTable.h"
    .
    .
    printTable(10);

(inside printTable.h)

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int printTable(int num)
{
    for (int i = 1; i < 11; i++)
    {
        cout << num << " X " << i << " = " << num * i << endl;
    }
}

/ *** GET THE GLOBAL VARIABLE *** /
int c = 1;
int main()
{
    int c = 2;
    cout << c;
    // This means print the global 'c' variable's value
    cout << ::c;
}

/ *** REFERENCE VARIABLES *** /
    int c = 2;
    // This means that b is referencing c's value
    int &b = c;
    cout << b << c; // 22
    // If you change the b, it'll also change c
    b = 3;
    cout << b << c; // 33

/ *** TYPECASTING *** /
    int a = 3;
    float b = 1.2001;
    cout << (float)a; // this is equivalent to float(a)
    cout << (int)b;

/ *** CONSTANTS *** /
    // You can write like both
    const int a = 3;
    int const a = 3;

/ *** MANIPULATORS *** /
1. endl - For moving the following code to a new line
2. setw(4) - This will align any character right which is going to be printed after this function, and will set its width to 4 characters(in this context). NOTE: You need to include <iomanip> library to use this func
i.e.
    int a = 12;
    cout << "a's value is " << setw(10) << a; // a's value is         12









Intro:
The answer is formed as a 'advantage/disadvantage' essay, it should be stating how the situation is a positive/negative development
line 2 - you missed paraphrasing the 'in many parts of the world' part 
line 2 - spelling mistake - ones, compared
line 2 - compared to 'the' past
line 3 - The immediate sentence after paraphrasing shouldn't contain a linker, as you haven't presented the first view yet
line 4 - Instead of jumping immediately on the point, first answer the the question which is asked in the question statement. i.e. Here, the question is asking if the given situation is a positive or a negative development, so start the sentence with starter words such as 'absolutely/surely/definitely, it is a positive/negative development...'
line 4 - some limitations 'should be imposed' which 'can' prevent them 'from' being rude...
line 6 - spelling mistake - pros
avoid using the pair 'pros-cons', as it's semi-formal, use advantage/disadvantage and benefits/drawbacks instead
line 7 - further 'in the essay'

Body 1:
If using 'On the other hand'(in body3), you must use 'On the one hand' first, they both should be used simultaneously.
line 2 - 'being self-dependent' or just 'being independent', self-independent is a wrong word combination
line 2 - incorrect use of 'while', instead the sentence flow should be like this, 'Allowing them to make their own decisions as per their interests surely yields better and satisfactory outcomes in their personal as well as academic future'
line 6 - them 'to perform' well
line 6 - all the 'choices' that they have made
line 7 - instead of 'this positive behaviour...', resulting them to succeed in whichever field they have chosen
last sentence - according to me, it's quite wrong, as everyone has that independence of choosing their friends, so there would be an opinion conflict with that sentence

Body 2:
You've continued to explain the same point(and that too isn't linking to the point correctly), which can lead to negative marking, so you need to have atleast 2 points to explain in every essay
line 1 - comma after 'previous time'
line 2 - only available? only available to what?
line 4 - 'into abroad'❌ 'to abroad'✔️
line 5 - the point 'and many of them...' isn't making sense in this context; instead, you can write as 'Many parents are sending their children to abroad countries for their higher studies, which makes them truly independent as they would have to live make decisions by themselves 
example sentence - avoid examples like this(based on stats) as even examiners know that they're being faked, so try to come up with your own relative's/friend's example, that would be more realistic
last line - good name over these?

Body 3:
line 2 - react negatively, but who is the 'reactor'? mention 'parents'
line 2 - in some children❌ in some families✔️
line 3 - due to 'the' lack of time
line 4 - Apostrophe 's' can be used with plural words as: parents'
line 4 - schedules 'do' not allow them
line 6 - 'forces'
line 8 - spelling error - collegian; it would be just 'college students', in this context
line 9 - 'victim of bad habits such as...'
line 10 - The reason behind 'this' is that 'due to' hectic lifestyle
line 11 - in the matter of saving time❌  in order to save time✔️
line 13 - 'That is why', avoid using shorthands

Conclusion:
- I would suggest stating every point that you've explained in the essay in short in the conclusion and in the intro too.
- You need to mention what your point-of-view was throughout the essay, but you've written the essay in a way in which it seems like you've made a fusion of both advantage/disadvantage essay and 'what-extent' essay, first need to make the content according to the question type
line 1 - It is not necessary 'that'...
line 3 - wrong use of inspite
